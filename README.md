## Project Overview

CPU Scheduling Simulator is a university Operating Systems project designed to demonstrate and visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms work.  
The simulator provides an interactive interface for entering process details and observing scheduling results in a tabular format.


## Author

- **Developer:** Sushita Roy Chowdhury

> Note: This project was fully designed, implemented, and tested by **Sushita Roy Chowdhury** for academic learning purposes.


## Algorithms Implemented

The simulator supports the following CPU scheduling algorithms:

- **FCFS** – First Come First Serve  
- **SJF** – Shortest Job First  
- **SRTF** – Shortest Remaining Time First  
- **Priority Scheduling** – Preemptive
- **RR** – Round Robin


## Features

- Algorithm selection via dropdown menu  
- Dynamic process input system  
- Supports both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling  
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Completion Time (CT)  
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)  
  - Waiting Time (WT)  
- Clean and simple user interface  


## User Interface Inputs

The frontend allows users to input the following:

- **Select Algorithm** – Choose CPU scheduling algorithm  
- **Process ID (PID)**  
- **Arrival Time (AT)**  
- **Burst Time (BT)**  
- **Priority**  
  - Higher number = higher priority  
- **Time Quantum**  
  - Required for Round Robin scheduling  


## Output Table

After calculation, results are displayed in a table with the following columns:

| Process | AT | BT | Priority | CT | TAT | WT |
|--------|----|----|----------|----|-----|----|


## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the simulator  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Core scheduling logic and calculations  


## How It Works

1. User selects a CPU scheduling algorithm from the dropdown.  
2. User enters process details:
   - Process ID  
   - Arrival Time  
   - Burst Time  
   - Priority (if applicable)  
   - Time Quantum (for Round Robin)  
3. User clicks **Add Process** to add processes.  
4. User clicks **Calculate** to execute the scheduling algorithm.  
5. Results are displayed in a structured table showing CT, TAT, and WT.
